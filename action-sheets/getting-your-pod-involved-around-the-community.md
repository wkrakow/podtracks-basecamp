# Action Sheet: Getting your Pod Involved Around the Community

#### A focus on making a difference in the community can unite members around the endeavor and attract new people to the movement

* Select a local restaurant with plant-based options. Call in advance and ask for a WFPB meal for your group. Eat out at that restaurant, which might encourage them to offer healthier plant-based meals. Choose that same or another restaurant and repeat.
* Participate in our Restaurant Campaign to increase the number of plant-based, oil free food options available in your town. Consider creating a committee that is responsible for reaching out to restaurants.
* Start a gardening project as a group at a local community garden.
* Volunteer at a local animal sanctuary.
* Open a whole food, plant-based food bank for low-income people who want to eat a plant-based diet.
* Show various plant-based documentaries at senior centers and then have a discussion group (see if a dietitian supporting plant-based eating, Plant-Based Nutrition Course Graduate, or Food for Life Instructor would help facilitate the discussion).
* Work through the public school system to get them to offer one WFPB meal option on the school menu (and ideally, have it be included in the reduced-cost/free menu options). Find more information on this project at the PCRM site [here](http://www.pcrm.org/health/healthy-school-lunches).&#x20;
* Work with local farmers to provide a farmers’ market in low-income neighborhoods, and then help to publicize and create traffic so that the market will continue to be offered.
* Organize a local Health Fair or VegFest. Learn more about his project <mark style="color:red;">here.</mark>&#x20;
* Offer to teach cooking classes to groups with whom Pod members already have a relationship, such as a local church, school, cancer support groups, YMCA, etc.
* Offer to facilitate Jumpstarts in your local church or at your work, and then have your Pod provide additional cooking and shopping training. Learn more <mark style="color:red;">here.</mark>&#x20;
* Don’t forget to reach out to local media to let them know about any of your Pod’s community events so they can take pictures/video and publish a story!
