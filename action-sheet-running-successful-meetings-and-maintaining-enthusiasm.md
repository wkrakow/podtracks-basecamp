# Action Sheet: Running Successful Meetings and Maintaining Enthusiasm

## Ways to Maintain and Increase Attendance

### Picking a Date

* You may choose to hold meetings on different days or at various times to accommodate a variety of schedules. Some Pods choose to set the same day and time for their meetings to make meetings a regular events on their members’ calendars. Decide what will work best for you and your Pod.
* If possible, schedule in advance or be prepared to schedule the next meeting at the end of the current meeting. That way you can announce it to everyone in attendance and check to see if the time works for most people present.
* Check the local calendar for events happening in your area, and try to plan your meetings to avoid conflicts.

### Choosing a Location

* Hold meetings at locations that are convenient to Pod members. If your Pod covers a large area, alternate between a couple of locations. Seek member help on securing space in areas unknown to you.
* Restaurants are great, but they can be noisy and sometimes it can be difficult to get the entire group seated together. Other locations might include the community room in a local library, a member’s home, church community rooms, local college/university, YMCA, or parks during good weather (there are shelter and picnic areas).
* When choosing a location, remember to consider parking options, access to the building and restrooms, audio-visual equipment, etc. If you plan to show a movie or give a presentation, ensure in advance that you’ll have the A/V equipment that you need and practice setting it up so you know it works.

### Meeting Tips

* Provide WFPB snacks at your meetings. You can ask for volunteers to commit to providing this, or combine the meeting with a potluck.
* Start and finish your meeting as scheduled and avoid long meetings.
* Introductions - It is always useful to start the meeting asking each person to say their name and one or two sentences about themselves. It is also useful to introduce the purpose of the meeting early on and remind people that the group is part of the grassroots movement getting underway via PlantPure Communities.
* Welcome newcomers - For many people, it can be intimidating to join a new group, especially if they don’t already know someone. Make sure new guests are greeted individually when they come to your meeting.
* Accept everyone - It will be useful to verbally recognize that people are in different places in their wellness journeys. This will encourage more people to feel comfortable to actively engage in the group. Many people will not join or show up at future meetings if they feel they are being judged or that they must be 100% plant-based. By accepting members exactly where they are, you are giving them the time and space to make lifestyle adjustments at their own pace.
* Plan social time - Allow a little time at the beginning of the meeting for people to greet and socialize; remember, building community is a core goal for Pods.

## Ways to Keep People Engaged and Enthusiastic

### Keeping Meetings Fresh

* Think about the message you want people to receive from the specific meeting and have a planned agenda for your meeting with that take-away in mind.
* Invite speakers to offer presentations. See PPC’s “Finding Speakers for Pod Meetings” Action Sheet for ideas.
* Offer door prizes such as books or DVDs. Consider asking Pod members if they want to donate things for door prizes.
* Identify one or more long-term projects with the Pod to undertake and share the responsibility of working on it with members. Make time at each meeting to hear updates about the project and seek feedback. For project ideas, check out the Toolkits available on the PlantPure CommunitiesResources page of the Pod website. Toolkits will be made available on an ongoing basis, so check back often for new ones and let us know if you have an idea for a Toolkit.
* Invite members on a tour of a local animal sanctuary, grocery store, or other point of common interest.
* Plan family-friendly projects and activities for one of your meetings.

### Staying in Touch and Getting to Know One Another

* Always have a sign-up sheet with email addresses so that you know the names and contacts of people who attended the meeting and can be sure to include them in future invitations. Make time to reach out to members who missed one or two meetings.
* Between meetings, stay in touch with members via email, a Facebook group, or other interactive discussion settings. Share articles, recipes, etc., to encourage engagement.&#x20;
* At meetings, play a “name game” and/or offer name tags so that people can get to know each other. Name games can help people learn each other's names, begin conversations, and set everyone in the group at ease. They can be followed by other “ice-breaking” activities.
* Engage members in discussion, allow everyone to speak and be heard.
* Maintain an open door policy for members to make suggestions.
