# Establishing membership

## Develop An Identity

* A fun or catchy group name can entice people’s interest in your Pod.
* Build a purpose people can get behind. Consider what motivated or inspired you to embrace a WFPB lifestyle.
* Are there particular aspects of the lifestyle that you'd like the Pod to focus on? Hold regular meetings - e.g., monthly or quarterly - so people become familiar with your Pod.
* Design flyers (printed and digital) and other Pod materials that are consistent in format, colorful, and unique for easy recognition. (Make use of PPC’s growing resources).

## Use Your Resources

* Recruit friends and family to participate in the Pod and spread the word--ask them to share flyers and bring others they know who may be interested in meetings.&#x20;
* Post about your Pod on Facebook and other social media, or email your personal contact list. Consider creating a Facebook group for members to join.
* Join local online plant-based Facebook and Meetup groups that might be interested.&#x20;
* Contact your local newspaper and ask if they will run a small ad or feature.
* Send your Pod information to local radio and TV stations for publicity.
* Submit upcoming events to community calendars and newsletters.
* Request organizations and businesses with shared values to help promote your Pod. Consider asking animal shelters, garden clubs, gyms, fitness groups, churches, hospitals, nonprofits, farmers markets, school boards, and city councils.
* Post flyers on community, church, school and workplace bulletin boards. You can print flyers at home or at Staples, Kinko’s, and other office supply stores. For online designs, try PicMonkey or Canva (both are free to use).
* Hand out flyers and cards around town, especially in highly trafficked areas like grocery stores, restaurants, bookstores, gyms, small businesses, and coffee shops.
* PPC Pod Support Team can send an email to PlantPure supporters in your area letting them know about your upcoming event. Simply email the Pod Support Team and they will send out the announcement.
* Set up a table at large events in the community (vegfests, concerts, famous speakers, back to school events).

## Create A Buzz

* Build excitement by designing fun activities like potlucks, cooking classes, farm field trips, movie screenings.&#x20;
* Featuring a well-known figure (local or otherwise) can encourage people to attend.&#x20;
* Work with local plant-based restaurants for name recognition and mutual advertising.
* Engage your community by supporting a local organization or raising money for a cause.
* Participate in local events like VegFest, Seed Exchange, farmers markets and health fairs where you promote your Pod while meeting potential members. Be enthusiastic, welcoming, and believe in what you’re doing!
